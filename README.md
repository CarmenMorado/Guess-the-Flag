# Guess-the-Flag
100 Days of Swift (Project 2) In this project, I learned to code a game that shows some random flags to users and asks them to choose which one belongs to a particular country.
The country to choose and the player's current score is shown at the top of the screen. Whenever the user clicks on a flag, an alert message appears on the screen to let the
user know if they chose the correct flag and their new score. After ten tries, another alert message will appear to let the user know their final score and that the game has finished.
In order to accomplish this task, I learned about asset catalogs, buttons, array shuffling, random number generation, @IBAction, and UIAlertController.

In addition, I completed the following (part 3) challenges:
-Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
-Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
-When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.

And the following (project 3) challenge:
-Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
